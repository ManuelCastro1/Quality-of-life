# Quality-of-life
This repository is about quality of life data

Data were merged from different sources in just one excel file. 
See https://github.com/ManuelCastro1/Calidad_de_vida for more info about data sources.

NOTE: HDI (Human Development Index) last year measure is from 2017, and other measures are from 2020, hence last graphs that use HDI against other measures could be inviased due to concistency of the data (it could not make sense at all if are from different years)
